The **Ryno Engine** is an open source 3D game engine I've been developing in C++ since 2014\. During the development I kept an online diary, updated daily with every change made to the engine along with a screenshot.

Th engine main feature is the **rendering engine**, based on OpenGL 4.0 and structured around the deferred rendering technique. The Ryno Engine also include a simple **network engine** based on the Winsock api. Finally, I'm working on a impulse-based **physics engine**, but the project is still work in progress.
